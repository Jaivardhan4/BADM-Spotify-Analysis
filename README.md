   - **Description**: Visualized the streaming trends over time.
   - **Steps**: Adjusted the date granularity as needed.

5. **Top Genres**:
   - **Description**: Visualized the popularity of genres.
   - **Steps**: Sorted and filtered to display the top 10 or 20 genres.

### 5. Creating Dashboards
- **Steps**:
  - Combined the visualizations into interactive dashboards.
  - Dragged and dropped the worksheets onto the dashboard.
  - Resized and arranged the visualizations to fit the dashboard layout.

### 6. Adding Filters and Interactivity
- **Description**: Added filters and interactive elements (e.g., dropdowns, sliders) to the dashboard to allow users to interact with the visualizations.
- **Steps**:
  - Added filters to relevant fields such as "Artist" or "Country".
  - Displayed filters as dropdowns or sliders.
  - Synchronized filters across visualizations to ensure they affect all relevant visualizations in the dashboard.
  - Added filter and highlight actions to enhance interactivity.

### 7. Publishing and Sharing
- **Steps**:
  - Published the dashboard to Tableau Server or Tableau Public.
  - Shared the link to the published dashboard with others or embedded it in a website.

## Analysis and Insights
